// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
let firstNum = prompt("What is the first number?");
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
let secondNum = prompt("What is the second number?");
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  
alert(`SUM: ${firstNum + secondNum} `);
alert(`DIFF: ${firstName - secondNum}`);
alert(`PRODUCT: ${firstName * secondNum}`);
alert(`QUOTIENT: ${firstName / secondNum}`)

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
